/**
 The RNDMultiValuePredicateBinder enables the construction of a set of predicates that can be used to provide filtering options in search boxes, column headers, or any other scenario where uses can choose from a set of named options that correspond to a predicate.
 
 This binder manages one or more bindings that connect to a data source and provide named arguments to the binder. The binder maintains an array of user facing strings, an array of predicates, and a combined dictionary where the keys are the user facing strings that correspond to a predicate. Both keys and predicates may contain arguments that will be replaced when the binder value is requested. For example, a key can be "Recent search results for $PERSONNAME" and a corresponding predicate could be "personName==$PERSONNAME". The key uses NSRegularExpression replacement syntax and the predicate uses NSPredicate replacement syntax.
 
 This binder is a read only binder which means it can not write to its model objects, but it does update the values of its observer when requested.
