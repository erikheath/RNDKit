Typically, this processing involves the value of the observed object's property, but this is not a requirement, and is often not used.
 
 The difference between the two output types is illustrated by the RNDRegExNode which can output a regular expression as its processorValue, or can apply that regular expression and replacement template to the value of it's observed object's property. The RNDPredicateNode, RNDInvocationNode, and RNDExpression processor have similar behavior.

 @class RNDBindingProcessor
 
 @version 1.0a
 
 @updated 9-12-2017

 @abstract The RNDBindingProcessor class is the base class for all processors in the RNDBindings system.

 @discussion The RNDBindingProcessor class provides foundational support for binding to a Key-Value Coding compliant object's properties. When used as an inflow value processor of a binder, an RNDBindingProcessor forms a read-only binding to an observed object, connecting to and optionally Key-Value Observing an object's property. When used as an outflow value processor of a binder, an RNDBindingProcessor forms a write-only binding, connecting to an observed object's property and updating it as directed by the RNDBinder.
 
 While subclasses can extend RNDBindingProcessor to provide enhanced processing capabilities, the base class provides significant functionality including:
 
 <ul>
 <li> A sync queue that synchronizes read/write access to the classes properties.
 
 <li> KVC-based reading/writing of an observed object's property with the ability to monitor the property for changes using Key-Value Observing (KVO).
 
 <li> The option to read-from/write-to an observed object on the main queue.
 
 <li> The option to set placeholders for specific values such as nils, NSNull instances, and controller markers.
 
 <li> The ability to transform a value.
 
 <li> A number of other options used by subclasses to create arbitrarily complex processing trees.
 </ul>
 
 Because of this and because of the requirements when subclassing (see below), it is often better to compose functionality by creating a processing tree of RNDBindingProcessors and/or its subclasses than creating a more specialized subclass.
 
 @remark All RNDBindingProcessor properties are fully synchronized, and any subclasses should use the syncQueue or coordinate with it when introducing new properties. The syncQueue is a concurrent queue supporting a multi-read/single-write access model. Internally, the class implements this behavior using a dispatch barrier for writes. All property access (including writes) are synchronous which ensures that any calls after a property is written to will reflect the new (or any subsequent) value.
 
 In addition, all RNDBindingProcessor properties are readonly when a class instance has been bound by calling either the bind or bind:error methods. This ensures that information necessary for unbinding and removing KVO from observered objects is not prematurely deleted before that process is completed. To enable this, both the bind/bind:error methods and the unbind/unbind:error methods execute the bindObjects:error and unbindObjects:error methods respectively on the synchQueue using an exclusion barrier that prevents other objects from reading/writing while the bindng/unbinding process takes place.
 
 @note When subclassing RNDBindingProcessor, it may be necessary to add functionality to the binding and unbinding process, for example to initialize properties added by the subclass or to perform additional checks relevant to the subclass. To accomplish this, subclasses should override the bindObjects and unbindObjects methods, calling the super class's implementation at the beginning of the method and exiting if the super class's binding operation is unsuccessful. In addition, if the subclass's custom binding process is not successful, the subclass should call the super class's unbindObjects implementation to return the instance to an unbound state. It is also good practice to call the subclasses implementation of unbindObjects to clean up any changed state. Doing this should return the object to a pristine state ready to attempt binding again. By overriding the bindObjects:error and unbindObjects:error methods, you will not need to override the bind/bind:error methods and the unbind/unbind:error methods as they are used as the public interface to call the bindObjects and unbindObjects methods on the syncQueue.

#pragma mark - Observed Object Management

/**
 @abstract The observed object is an object that exposes a KVC-compliant property (that property can be self) that can be read from and optionally monitored using KVO.
 
 @discussion In standard usage, the observed object is a controller or model object that provides or receives data to/from a processor. A common example of this usage is the binding of a view object to a mediating controller (for example, an RNDObjectController). In this scenario, a processor is used to read data from the controller when requested by the view object (through an RNDBinder) and to optionally monitor the controller for changes which are forwarded to the view so it's value remains synchronized with the mediating controller. An additional processor is used to write changes that originate from the view to the mediating controller (through the same RNDBinder). In this scenario, the two processors and the binder create a binding between the mediating controller and the view object, enabling synchronization of a value.
 
 It is also possible, and often very useful to create processor processors that use an observed object as a value source or update trigger. As a value source, an observed object can be used as an evaluation object, for example the source of text that a regular expression should be evaluated against. As an update trigger, an observed object can be used solely for the purpose of monitoring some property for changes that should trigger some action. These two activities can be used together, or they can be used apart to create more nuanced processing flows.
 
 @warning A keypath must be set when setting an observed object, even if the keypath is "self".
 
 */
@property (strong, nullable, readwrite) NSObject *observedObject;

/**
 @abstract A KVC compliant keypath pointing to a KVC and optionally KVO compliant property on the observed object.
 
 @discussion The observed object keypath is applied to the observed object via the valueForKeyPath: and/or setValue:forKeyPath Key-Value Coding (KVC) methods. If a processor is being used to get a value from the observed object, any of the KVC operators that are compatible with the property referred to by the keypath may be used. For example, if an object has property "testScores" that is an array of numbers, the "\@avg" operator may be used on the array of numbers to return the array's average by setting the keypath to:
 
 @code
 
 @avg.testScores
 
 @endcode
 
  The "self" keyword can be used to refer to the observed object itself, enabling operators to be applied to it. For example, if the observed object is an array of numbers, the following would result in the average of the array's values.
 
 @code
 
 @avg.self
 
 @endcode
 
 @note It is not possible to observe the result of a collection operator as the result is transient.

 Because many objects are not KVC and KVO compliant, care should be taken when enabling monitoring. In general, it is best to only monitor objects that are known to be compliant with the two protocols, or to perform  testing to ensure that objects behave in a compliant manner.
