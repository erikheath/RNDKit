/**
 The RNDMultiValuePredicateBinder enables the construction of a set of regular expressions that can be used to provide content search options in search boxes or any other scenario where uses can choose from a set of named options that correspond to a regular expression.
 
 This binder manages one or more bindings that can connect to a data source. The binder is specialized to maintain an array of user facing strings, an array of RNDRegExBinding objects, and a combined dictionary where the keys are the user facing strings that correspond to a RNDRegExBinding. Keys may contain arguments that will be replaced when the binder value is requested. For example, a key can be "Find  $PERSONNAME in $CONTENTSECTION" where both $PERSONNAME and $CONTENTSECTION are replaced based on a user's selection.
 
 This binder is a read only binder which means it can not write to its model objects, but it does update the values of its observer when requested or when triggered.
