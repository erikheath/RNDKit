Given that the receiver has been registered with -objectDidBeginEditing: as the editor of some object, and not yet deregistered by a subsequent invocation of -objectDidEndEditing:, attempt to commit the result of the editing. When committing has either succeeded or failed, send the selected message to the specified object with the context info as the last parameter. The method selected by didCommitSelector must have the same signature as:

- (void)editor:(id)editor didCommit:(BOOL)didCommit contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo;

If an error occurs while attempting to commit, because key-value coding validation fails for example, an implementation of this method should typically send the NSView in which editing is being done a -presentError:modalForWindow:delegate:didRecoverSelector:contextInfo: message, specifying the view's containing window.
